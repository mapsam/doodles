# Draw

Vector drawings are pretty fun. So is CSS3. Why not combine them? This is just a collection of my SVG/CSS3 work.

I'm using Adobe Illustrator for my initial drawings, using Iconic's [SVGInjector](https://github.com/iconic/SVGInjector) to place SVGs into the DOM, and manually editing their `class`/`id` to match CSS styles for color and animation.
